# Running the SAC Agent on Hopper-v5 Environment

This repository demonstrates how to load and run a pre-trained Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent on the Hopper-v5 environment from OpenAI Gymnasium. The environment will be rendered in real-time while the agent interacts with it.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you need the following:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **Gymnasium**: For the Hopper-v5 environment and rendering.
- **Stable-Baselines3**: For the pre-trained SAC model and reinforcement learning algorithms.

### Install Dependencies

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install gymnasium stable-baselines3
```
